outside from social network web sites.</p><h3>Fine... who are you?</h3><p>Didn't you see the header?
I have been doing full stack web development
for many years.<br>Now I still enjoy doing it as much as I
enjoy to run away from my screen to do something real.</p><h3>Why this site looks weird?</h3><p>I am the kind of developer with discutible
knowledge and taste in design.<br>I use on a daily basis sofisticated libraries for
UI and logic... I liked the wild freedom of doing
everything from scratch.</p><h3>Are you happy with it?</h3><p>I surely am... and I don't aim to show off.<br>I felt like the good old times when I was just
learning html and css.<br>Even without much more, the web can always be
a beatiful communication platform and a space
for creativity.</p></section><footer><p>This is my footer!</p></footer></content><script src="/main.017ad746.js"></script>
